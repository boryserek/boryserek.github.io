  I am a sonic artist, technologist, educator, and labor organizer.
  <br>
  <br>
  I'm interested in superhuman prolongation, opaque complexity, the re-signification of archaic tools and materials, and parallels between the physical properties and social meanings of spaces.
  <br>
  I practice improvisation with bespoke electronics and with the <a href="https://archive.org/details/cnx-org-col10219">French horn</a>, my mother tongue.
  <br>
  I value machines for their patience.
  <br>
